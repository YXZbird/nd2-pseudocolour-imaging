Batch processing and pseudocolour rendering of ND2 confocal microscopy images using Python.
# ND2 Pseudocolour Imaging Pipeline

This repository demonstrates a Python-based workflow for batch processing
ND2 confocal microscopy files, including channel-wise preprocessing,
Z-projection, and pseudocolour RGB rendering.

The notebook is intended as a compact portfolio example for quantitative
bioimage analysis workflows.

**Note:** Raw ND2 data are not included due to file size constraints.
