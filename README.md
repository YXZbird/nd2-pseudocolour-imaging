ND2 pseudocolour imaging and quantitative analysis

This repository contains a small but complete Python workflow for processing and quantifying ND2 confocal microscopy data.
It was developed for imaging-driven biological projects where microscopy images are treated as quantitative data, rather than only as figures for visualisation.

The pipeline performs batch processing of ND2 files, generates consistent pseudocolour images for inspection, and extracts pixel-level and object-level measurements using standard tools from scikit-image.

The emphasis is on clarity, reproducibility, and transferability, rather than on highly specialised or over-fitted analysis.

**Note:** Raw ND2 data are not included due to file size constraints.
