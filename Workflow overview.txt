Workflow overview

ND2 import
ND2 files are loaded and normalised to (C, Z, Y, X).
If a time axis is present, the first time point is analysed.

Z-projection
Each channel is collapsed into 2D using max or mean projection.

Preprocessing (scikit-image)

Background subtraction (Gaussian filtering)

Intensity normalisation

Adaptive histogram equalisation (CLAHE)

Mild Gaussian smoothing

Pseudocolour rendering
Processed channels are combined into an RGB image
(488 → red, 568 → green, DAPI → blue).

Pixel-level quantification
Intensity distributions are summarised using basic statistics.

Signal mask generation
Otsu thresholding and morphological filtering define signal regions.

Object-level measurement
Connected components are labelled and measured using
skimage.measure.regionprops_table.

Outputs

Per-file summary table

Object-level feature tables (CSV)
